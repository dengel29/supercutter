# Supercutter (working title)

Simply put, Supercutter creates supercuts of YT videos based on keywords: give it a video and a keyword, and it will slice up the video anywhere that word appears, re-stitch it, and give you a video download link. 

## Tech

* Express (Typescript) server;
* FFMPEG to edit the videos;
* HTML and AlpineJS on the front-end;

## Inspiration

Inpsired by videogrep, the Python supercutter. 

## Credits

Made by me. Look at the `package.json` for list of tools which I couldn't have built this without. 

This project was kickstarted from this very nice [node-typescript-boilerplate](https://github.com/jsynowiec/node-typescript-boilerplate), it's a nice place to start.
